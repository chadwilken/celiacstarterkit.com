# Celiac Starter Kit

## Introduction

Welcome to the exclusive Celiac Club, where every traveler has a unique journey to share. As someone who knows firsthand the challenges of living with celiac disease, I understand the overwhelming feeling of being thrust into this club without a choice. But fear not, my friend, because with knowledge comes power, and in this book, I will share everything I wish I had known when I first started out.

Join me as we navigate the ins and outs of celiac disease together. From the tricky business of cross contamination to the joys of finding safe and delicious food, we'll cover it all. And for those moments when you feel alone, know that there's a community of support waiting for you.

Life with celiac disease can be challenging, but armed with the right information and a supportive community, it can also be fulfilling and delicious. So come along and let's explore getting started with celiac disease together.

### About Me

Before we embark on this journey together, I want to make something clear: I'm not a medical expert or a certified nutritionist. I'm just like you – a person living with celiac disease who's had their fair share of struggles and triumphs. But what I lack in formal credentials, I more than make up for in personal experience and knowledge gained through trial and error.

I've spent years researching, experimenting, and connecting with others in the gluten free community to gather insights and tips on living with celiac disease. My goal is to share these hard-earned lessons with you in a way that's practical, informative, and relatable. Whether you're newly diagnosed or a seasoned gluten-free pro, my hope is that you'll find something in this book that will help you on your journey.

So, while I can't offer medical advice, I can offer something just as valuable – a wealth of information that's been curated with care. Let's learn and grow together, and create a community that empowers us to live our best lives, one gluten-free step at a time

### Some Things to Note

I understand that some of the recommendations and practices outlined in this book may seem daunting or even extreme. However, as someone who has experienced the consequences of even the slightest cross contamination, I take no chances when it comes to my health and well-being.

Living with celiac disease requires a heightened awareness of what we consume, how it's prepared, and where it comes from. It can be a lot to manage, but it's necessary to avoid potentially serious health complications. While some of the precautions may seem excessive, I firmly believe that it's better to be safe than sorry.

So, while you may not need to follow every recommendation in this book to the letter, I encourage you to take them seriously and then figure out what works best for you. Living with celiac disease is not always easy, but with the right mindset and practices in place, it is absolutely possible to live a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life.

### Gluten Is Everywhere

Are you struggling to avoid gluten in your daily life? It may seem like an impossible task as gluten seems to be lurking in everything you consume, from your favorite bread to your trusted beauty products. But don't worry, there's no need to feel overwhelmed! The good news is that there are plenty of gluten-free options available. In fact, I'll provide you with valuable resources later in the book to help you navigate your gluten-free journey with ease. Get ready to live your best gluten-free life!

### Disease Definition 📙

Hopefully your doctor explained what celiac disease is, but just in case I will define it here.

> Celiac disease, sometimes called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine.

In order for something to be considered safe for you to eat it must contain less than **20 parts-per-million** gluten.

### Everyone is Different 👫

Living with Celiac Disease is not a one-size-fits-all experience. Everyone reacts differently to gluten, cross-contamination, and other triggers, ranging from mild to severe symptoms. Some individuals may even have something called *silent celiac*, where they don't experience any outward signs of the disease, but their intestines are still being damaged.

Once diagnosed, committing to a gluten-free diet is essential. While it may be tempting to give up after a while, this is something that must be maintained for life. But the good news is that following a gluten-free diet will allow your intestines to start to heal and you'll begin to notice improvements in your well-being. In fact, you could feel like your old self in as little as 6 months after starting your gluten-free diet.

## In the Kitchen 🧑‍🍳

### Cross Contamination

Oh no! You just uncovered a new peril when it comes to living with celiac disease - cross contamination! Basically, cross contamination is when something that has come into contact with gluten is then used to cook or handle gluten free food. This can happen in all sorts of sneaky ways, like using the same spoon to stir regular mac and cheese and then using that same spoon to stir your gluten free mac and cheese. Even sharing pots, pans, utensils, and even hand towels can lead to cross contamination. The most common method of cross contamination is touch a gluten containing food and then without washing your hands, touching gluten free food.

But don't worry - I'm here to help! I'll provide you with plenty of tips and tricks to help you steer clear of cross contamination. With a little bit of knowledge, you can keep your gluten free meals safe and delicious.

### Pots and Pans

If you've been sharing your non-stick pots and pans with gluten-filled food, it's time to hit the brakes. Even if you scrub them clean, the Teflon coating can get scratched, leaving pesky gluten particles lurking in the crevices. That means your gluten-free meals could be in danger! But don't worry, we've got you covered. The solution? Upgrade to a shiny new set of stainless steel pots and pans if your budget allows it! They may take some getting used to cooking with, but they're worth it for the peace of mind.

When cleaning your pans pans after cooking gluten containing food pay extra attention to places gluten could get lodged. An example of such a place is around the rivets that attach the handle.

### Utensils

As a person with celiac one of the most frustrating things I experienced was not knowing where I was getting glutened from while being on a strict gluten free diet. It took me a while to discover that sharing utensils with gluten-eaters can be one of the main culprits. I was shocked to find out that the silverware tray had little crumbs and particles of gluten that could contaminate the utensils. Don't believe me? Take a look at your own silverware holder. It's probably filled with gluten-filled crumbs too. That's why I highly recommend having your own dedicated gluten free utensil drawer to avoid any cross-contamination. Imagine having an entire drawer that's yours alone, free from any gluten risks. Plus, it's essential to keep in mind that some utensils, like wooden ones, are highly porous and can retain gluten. You don't want to take any risks, so make sure to avoid them or have dedicated gluten free versions.

If your child has celiac disease and uses plastic utensils I recommend having dedicated gluten free versions. If the utensils get scratches or have bit marks that is a great place for gluten to hide.

### Cooking Meals 🥗

Living in a mixed gluten environment can be a challenging task, but it's crucial to understand that gluten can be present on every countertop in your kitchen. That's why it's essential to take precautions to avoid any cross-contamination. One simple trick is to place a small plate on the countertop for utensils used while cooking. This way, you can set the utensil on the plate when you're not using it, preventing any crumbs that may be on the countertop from contaminating your utensil.

However, it's not just the countertops that you need to be cautious of. One of the most important rules in a mixed gluten environment is never to share utensils between gluten-containing and gluten-free food. Even the tiniest bit of gluten can trigger a severe reaction in someone with celiac disease. So, it's crucial to have separate utensils for gluten-free cooking and ensure that they are properly cleaned before and after use.

Additionally, don't make the mistake of assuming that heat or boiling water can "kill the gluten." Unfortunately, this is not the case. Even high temperatures cannot eliminate gluten, so it's crucial to clean all pots and pans thoroughly with soap before using them for gluten-free cooking. Don't reuse them without washing them first, and make sure that all surfaces that come into contact with gluten-containing foods are cleaned with separate sponges and towels to avoid any cross-contamination.

If you're someone who juggles cooking both gluten and gluten-free meals at the same time, it's crucial to keep your hands clean. You must make it a habit to wash your hands every time you touch gluten-containing food before handling gluten free food. In fact, I go the extra mile and maintain a separate hand towel solely for gluten-free use. To avoid cross-contamination, I hang it up high on a hook that's out of reach for little ones.

### Doing the Dishes 🍽️

If you have a dishwasher, I recommend pre-rinsing and using it to clean all dishes that you will use for gluten-free food. Washing dishes by hand, especially if you're sharing a sponge or washcloth, has the possibility of not scrubbing all the gluten off or cross-contaminating the gluten-free dishes. For the items that you wash by hand I recommend having a dedicated sponge and dish towel to avoid contamination. Keep them in a separate area so that everyone knows that they need to be kept clean.

### Dedicated Items

You should get a dedicated gluten free version of anything that you use to cook or handle gluten containing food that cannot be easily washed or that is porous and could harbor gluten. Some items that you should get gluten free versions of:

- Toaster
- Condiments such as butter where the knife will be used on gluten containing items
- Pizza cutter
- Silicon utensils - they can get scratched in my experience
- Colander, especially if it’s plastic
- Tupperware
- Air fryer - if non-stick coating
- Cookie sheets - if non-stick coating

## Food 🍕

Fortunately, the gluten-free food industry has seen remarkable growth in the past decade. Nowadays, you can find gluten-free variations of almost anything you can imagine. From pizzas to pastas, from bread to beer, there are gluten-free options that can make your dining experience enjoyable again. Restaurants are also stepping up their game, with many establishments offering gluten free menus and some even have dedicated prep areas. Now, you don't have to feel left out when dining out with friends and family. I will include some apps below that will help you find a safe place to eat while traveling or while enjoying a night out.

### At the Grocery Store 🏪

The first trip to the grocery store after being diagnosed with celiac disease can be a daunting experience. You'll find yourself questioning the safety of your regular brands and scouring the aisles for gluten-free options. It can be a time-consuming process, and you might even end up spending 2-3 times longer than your usual shopping trips just to read the labels carefully. When I was first diagnosed I found myself at the grocery store 2-3 times per week. Each trip was 80% me on my phone googling if something is gluten free.

But don't worry, with a bit of guidance, you can speed up your shopping experience and find the brands you can trust. After a few months, you'll be back to ordering your groceries online with ease. The good news is that many grocery stores in North America now have a dedicated gluten-free section. Even retail giants like Walmart have embraced the gluten-free trend and offer a wide variety of gluten-free products.

#### Certified or Not, That is the Question

There are organizations in most countries that will certify that a product is gluten free, such as the [Gluten-Free Certification Organization](https://gfco.org/). There are several different organizations and the requirements vary from one the other and from one country to the next. In general though if something is Certified Gluten Free it is safe to eat.

Search for products that you enjoy and search their labels for “gluten free”. Be careful though and do your research. Some items may be labelled gluten free but are still **processed in factories that process gluten containing ingredients**. You will have to rely a bit on trial and error until you figure out the foods and brands that are safe to eat. When in doubt use one of the apps listed below or ask in one of the recommended communities. Over time you will find brands that you know and trust won’t make you sick.

To make things even more confusing, you will find foods that aren’t labelled gluten free but are still safe to eat. Nuts are a good example of something that may not be labelled gluten free but there are various brands that are safe to eat such as Blue Diamond (in my experience).

#### Apps to Help with the Hunt

Luckily we live in the age where “there is an app for that”. There are a handful of apps that allow you to scan the barcode of a product to find out if it is gluten free. My personal favorite is “The Gluten Free Scanner”, it is available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-gluten-free-scanner/id969482476) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theglutenfreescan&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1). Once again, just because it isn’t in the app doesn’t mean it isn’t safe. In the case where it is missing I would read the ingredients list, ask in one of the recommended communities or as a last resort use your gut (pun intended) to decide. In my experience if the app doesn’t have the answer, one of the social communities linked below will.

### Eating Out

Eating out is no longer as simple as hitting the nearest drive-thru. You will now have to consider if a restaurant has gluten-free options, how well they can accommodate your restrictions, and how likely is the risk of cross contamination.

Don’t worry though, with a little research and planning you will find that there are quite a few restaurants that have a gluten free menu and some even have a dedicated gluten free prep area. I have been to restaurants that have been fully gluten free. When I stumble across one of those gems I tend to over-eat and over-spend just a little bit.

It’s important when you go out to eat that you inform your waiter that you have a gluten allergy. I often tell them it’s an allergy as it helps them understand the seriousness of the situation. If you tell them you have celiac disease they often will not know what that is, but most have heard of a gluten allergy before. You will find at some of the popular gluten free restaurants that when you mention having celiac disease that they will immediately start listing their gluten free options and their safety protocols.

There are two great apps for finding restaurants that have been reviewed by the community and deemed safe to eat. The first is [Find Me Gluten Free](https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/), which allows you to search and filter by a variety of criteria. You can read reviews and tips about eating at the establishment submitted by users on a gluten free diet. Second is [Gluten Dude](https://glutendude.app/), this app helps you eat out, find gluten free beers, eat safely at airports, and connect with others. Both apps are a great resource to have in your pocket while out and looking for a bite to eat. Remember that just because a restaurant is in the app doesn’t mean that it is safe to eat at it. Be sure to check the ratings and read the reviews before going to any restaurant.

### At the Office 🏢

Being included at the office for things like shared meals can be a tricky situation if you have Celiac Disease. I’ve heard the horror stories of insensitive co-workers misunderstanding the seriousness of the illness and lumping it in with fad diets. But don’t worry – it doesn’t have to be that way! I often tell people that it’s a gluten allergy instead of just saying that I am gluten free, and this usually helps them take my dietary restrictions more seriously. Some companies will be better than others about including you and taking extra precaution about your restrictions. With a little bit of communication and understanding, you can make sure your office meals are safe. Get in touch with the person that handles organizing the food for work events and let them know that you’re willing to help them find a safe option for you to eat. I find that communicating early and often will ensure that you are included in the events that include food.

### Alcohol 🍺

Much like food, finding gluten free alcohol has gotten much easier as some brands will now label their alcohol gluten free. Just like food though, there are caveats and rules for alcohol as well.

Ciders are a great choice and are often labeled gluten free. Hard liquors require a little more research. You can check the company’s website in most cases to find out if the liquor is gluten free. If you’re a wine fan the rules are similar to hard liquors, it’s best to do a little research.

### Animal Food & Pet Supplies 🐕

This is a bit of a controversial topic. Some people don’t believe that a dog eating a food that contains gluten can impact you but I have felt it first hand. Think about it, your dog eats gluten containing food, licks your hand when you’re petting him, then a bit later you grab a snack and forget to wash your hands first. For dogs specifically there is also the debate about whether a gluten free food is bad for the dog. They say that grain free diets for dogs can increase their risk for heart related illnesses.

When you’re searching for pet supplies feel free to reach out to the supplier and ask if their items contain gluten or wheat, barley, or rye fillers. If they don’t know then I once again recommend asking the hive mind communities linked below.

## Social Communities

There are several really great and supportive communities that my wife and I are members of. They help with things like recipes, food reviews, food alerts, finding gluten free products, restaurants to try, travel tips, etc. If you’re on a social media platform chances are they will have a gluten free/celiac group of some sort. My favorites are:

- [Reddit - r/Celiac](https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/)
- [Reddit - r/glutenfree](https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/)
- [Facebook - Celiac Disease - Gluten Free Support Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1960316204295033/)
- [Facebook - Gluten Free Living & Recipe Share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/306706552826016)
- [Facebook - Gluten & Dairy Free Food & Discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/867377600391188/)

## Health, Wellness & Beauty 💁‍♀️

### Medicine 💊

Believe it or not you will have to check what is in all of your medications whether it’s prescription or over the counter. Medicines will vary from brand to brand as to whether it contains gluten or not. For example, some brands of ibuprofen contain gluten while others do not. It will be on the box or label if the medicine is gluten free or not.

You should review any of your prescriptions and check to make sure that they do not use gluten containing ingredients. There are several ways to check this. You can ask your pharmacist or you can contact the pharmaceutical company directly. In my experience I have been able to find the material sheet for the medication online and check the primary and inactive ingredients to ensure they are gluten free.

### Beauty Products 🧴

In general things that do not touch your lips or go in your mouth don’t need to be gluten free. There are a few caveats to this rule though. For example, if you have a wheat or gluten allergy then you need to make sure that your shampoo, lotion, and other products do not contain gluten. You only need to worry about shampoo and conditioner being gluten free if you worry that while washing your hair some will run into your mouth and ultimately be swallowed.

Products such as lip gloss or lip balm should be gluten free as there is a high chance for a small amount of them to be ingested. Most major brands will tell you on their website if their products are gluten free.

> 👉 If it doesn’t go on your lips or in your mouth then it likely doesn’t **need** to be gluten free. Take into consideration your own habits and sensitivities.


## Traveling ✈️

With a little preparation and foresight you can travel like the old days. Utilizing apps and the social communities above to find restaurants that are safe for you to eat will be made much easier.

### Preparation

Traveling with celiac disease requires a bit more planning than your average trip. You will want to look ahead for places to eat at your destination, bring snacks for while you’re traveling, and even speaking with the airline to make sure you have a gluten free meal for longer flights.

When going on road trips I like to pack a cooler with deli meats, fruits and vegetables so that I know I have a snack while we’re traveling. I like to bring along hand sanitizing wipes so that I can clean my hands before digging into a snack. This is especially helpful if you’re traveling with kids that will be enjoying snacks that contain gluten as they often need help preparing and cleaning up after their snack.

If you’re on the go it can be handy to pack a few plastic utensils as you may need to find something simple like a packet of tuna while you’re on the go. I often forget to pack the utensils and instead get a utensil packet wrapped in plastic from the deli area.

### Finding a Place to Eat

Apps make most things in life more convenient to access and this is true for finding gluten free restaurants. Using the apps above you can find a safe place to eat in most mid-large cities. If you know where you will be stopping along the trip you can ask ahead in the social communities above to find safe places to eat.

If you’re on the road and in a smaller town it can be a bit more difficult. I can’t tell you how many times I have resorted to eating a bag of chips and a KIND bar because there wasn’t anything for me to eat in small town USA. As I mentioned above, this is where a little preparation comes in handy. If there is a grocery store nearby consider grabbing some fruit and lunch meat for your meal. Another great alternative are tuna packets as their nutritionally dense, cheap, and easy to eat on the go.

### Flights

If you’re taking a longer flight such as when traveling internationally you will often have the option for a meal. In some cases you can call the airline ahead of time to arrange for a gluten free meal. I have heard mixed reviews about how successful this turns out in reality but it’s worth a try. When I went to Hawaii I packed a bunch of food in my backpack to last me the duration of the 12 hour travel day.

## Intimacy 💋

Think you can have a little fun with your partner without first worrying about gluten, try again. This is one of those controversial topics once again. I have read reports from some people that are able to kiss their significant other after they have consumed gluten without any response while others claimed that it caused problems for them. I often ask my wife if she is “gluten free” before giving her a kiss on the lips. The easiest solution is that they brush their teeth before indulging in a little fun so that you can feel safe the entire time.

There is some good news though, you don’t have to worry about gluten in sperm or other bodily fluids. Oral sex is perfectly safe as long as you have not used lubricants or other things that contain gluten. Most condoms are also gluten free and in fact there doesn’t seem to be a condom that contains gluten.
