# Welcome
This is the first attempt that I am aware of to open-source a guide for getting started with celiac disease.

I am sure you can recall how overwhelming it was to begin adjusting after being diagnosed. Numerous lifestyle changes were necessary simply to engage in an activity we do all the time: eating food.

My goal with this project is to create a place where the newly diagnosed can go to quickly get up to speed and learn the things that all of us now do without thinking.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project you can do so in one of two ways.
1. If you notice an error or would like to suggest an improvement you can file an [Issue](https://github.com/chadwilken/celiacstarterkit.com/issues)
2. Fork the repository, make improvements, and open a pull request to update the site.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Setup Ruby
3. Setup Jekyll & Install Gems
4. Start the server

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/chadwilken/celiacstarterkit.com
cd celiacstarterkit.com
```

### Setup Ruby
I recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage your Ruby versions. Follow the setup instructions for your operating system.

### Setup Jekyll & Install Gems
```
bundle install
```

### Start the Server
To start the local Jekyll server to see your changes run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Now you can visit: [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the site.
